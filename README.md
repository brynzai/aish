# AISH
The AI Shell
This shell takes your commands and does what you ask via translating them to intermediate scripting languages and running them. Beware the risk of AI running or deleting something you didn't expect. Use at your own risk.

# Scripts
The shell supports scripts. So you can write a script in human language:

```
#!/usr/bin/aish
tell me the time with timezone
```
Temp scripts are currently written to ~/.aish/ which is hard-coded to my own user unfortunately. Just trying to get initial commits.
More to come soon..
